## 🛠️ How It Works

- **IBAN generation**
  - Builds a BBAN from the selected bank code + random account number.
  - Calculates check digits using the **modulo 97** algorithm.
  - Formats the final IBAN as `SA + check digits + BBAN`.
- **Card generation**
  - Produces a Visa card number that satisfies the **Luhn** checksum.
  - Generates a realistic expiry date and a 3-digit CVV.
- **State & persistence**
  - UI state and history are stored in **localStorage** for quick retrieval.

## 🌍 Localization & Accessibility

- English and Arabic UI with RTL switching.
- Language preference is persisted in localStorage.
- Interactive controls include keyboard handlers and accessible labels.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS (CDN), Alpine.js (CDN)
- **Bundling**: Node.js script to expose the credit card helper in the browser
- **Testing**: Jest (for helper modules in `src/`)
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (no backend required)

## 📁 Project Structure

```text
public/          # Static site assets (index.html, logos, built creditCard.js)
src/             # Helper modules (card generator)
scripts/         # Build script to bundle creditCard helper for the browser
tests/           # Jest tests for generator logic
```

---

## ▶️ Running Locally

```bash
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

Or open `public/index.html` directly.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Bundling

Run `npm test` to execute the Jest suite. Helper modules in `src/` are CommonJS files used primarily for these tests.

To make the credit card generator available in the browser, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This bundles `src/creditCard.js` to `public/creditCard.js` and exposes a global `CreditCard` object used by the UI.
